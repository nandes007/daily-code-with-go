Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern and also one of the most commonly used design pattern. This pattern is used when only a single instance of the struct should exist. This single instance is called a singleton object. Some of the cases where the singleton object is applicable:
- DB instance – we only want to create only one instance of DB object and that instance will be used throughout the application. 
- Logger instance – again only one instance of the logger should be created and it should be used throughout the application.
